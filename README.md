This supercluster consists of 10 vertically-mounted M.2 2230 modules containing 16 CH32V203C8T6 microcontrollers (not compatible with real M.2 slots) on an M.2 2280 baseboard. Host-to-cluster communication goes through a PCI Express UART controller connected to a CH32V208 on the bottom of the baseboard. Communications inside the cluster go through a custom bus that connects all 160 CH32V203 nodes and the CH32V208 baseboard controller together. Full explanation is in the video below.
